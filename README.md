## Overview

Maudlin is a framework designed for rapid experimentation with neural networks. It streamlines the process of model creation, configuration, training, and evaluation. Key features include:

- YAML-based configuration for defining models and workflows.
- Support for feature engineering and preprocessing.
- Flexible training and prediction pipelines.
- Tools for visualizing and interpreting results.

## Getting Started

Follow the [Getting Started](https://github.com/savvato-software/savvato-maudlin-doc/blob/main/getting_started.md) guide to set up Maudlin and create your first experiment.
